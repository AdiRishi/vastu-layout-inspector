# Vastu Shastra Domain Knowledge

## Application Context
This is a **Vastu Layout Inspector** - a tool for analyzing home layouts according to Vastu Shastra principles, an ancient Indian architectural science emphasizing directional orientation in building design.

## Vastu Principles Integration

### 8-Direction System
The application implements a complete 8-direction compass system:

1. **North (N)** - Red color - Associated with career and opportunities
2. **Northeast (NE)** - Orange color - Prayer room, spiritual energy
3. **East (E)** - Amber color - New beginnings, sunrise energy
4. **Southeast (SE)** - Lime color - Kitchen location, fire element
5. **South (S)** - Emerald color - Fame and recognition
6. **Southwest (SW)** - Cyan color - Master bedroom, stability
7. **West (W)** - Violet color - Creativity and children
8. **Northwest (NW)** - Fuchsia color - Air element, movement

### Zone Classification System

The application uses a **three-tier color-coded system** for Vastu compliance:

- **游릭 Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: Optimal locations that enhance positive energy and align with Vastu principles
- **游리 Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: Workable locations that may require minor adjustments or remedies
- **游댮 Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Problematic locations that should be avoided or require major remediation

### Detailed Vastu Guidelines by Room/Feature

#### **Main Entrance**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: North, East, Northeast
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: West
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: South, Southwest, Southeast
- **Key Notes**: The "mouth" of the house; determines the quality of energy entering

#### **Kitchen**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: Southeast (SE)
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: Northwest (NW)
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Northeast, Southwest, North, Center
- **Key Notes**: SE is the zone of Fire (Agni). Placing it in the Water zone (NE) is a major conflict

#### **Master Bedroom**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: Southwest (SW)
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: None
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Southeast, Northeast
- **Key Notes**: SW provides stability (Earth element). Internal Check: Headboard must point South or East. Avoid North

#### **Other Bedrooms**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: West, Northwest, East
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: North, South
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Southwest (reserved for master), Southeast (can be too energetic)
- **Key Notes**: SE is the fire zone, which can be overly energetic for restful sleep

#### **Toilets/Bathrooms**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: Northwest (NW)
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: West, South, Southeast (with remedies)
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Northeast, Southwest, Center, East
- **Key Notes**: CRITICAL RULE: Waste disposal must not contaminate the sacred (NE) or stability (SW) zones

#### **Living Room**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: North, East, Northeast, Northwest
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: Center (if open)
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Southwest
- **Key Notes**: The social hub; should be in zones that promote positive energy and interaction

#### **Study Room**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: North, East, Northeast, West
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: None
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: South, Southwest, Southeast
- **Key Notes**: These directions are believed to enhance concentration, memory, and wisdom

#### **Pooja/Prayer Area**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: Northeast, East, North
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: None
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: South, SW, SE, Center, Under Stairs
- **Key Notes**: The spiritual center; must be in the most energetically pure zones

#### **Center (Brahmasth치ha)**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: Completely Open & Empty
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: None
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Any Obstruction (Walls, Pillars, Toilet, Kitchen, Stairs)
- **Key Notes**: CRITICAL RULE: This is the "lungs" of the house; blockages affect the entire home's energy

#### **Staircase**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: Southwest, South, West
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: North, East (can cause issues in some homes)
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Northeast, Center
- **Key Notes**: A heavy structure that can create an energy imbalance if placed in a light/sacred zone

#### **Balconies/Windows**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: North, East, Northeast
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: West
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: South, Southwest
- **Key Notes**: Maximizes beneficial morning sunlight and positive energy flow

#### **Heavy Furniture**
- **Excellent/Good (Green Zone)**: Southwest, South, West
- **Acceptable (Amber Zone)**: None
- **Inauspicious (Red Zone)**: Northeast, North, East, Center
- **Key Notes**: Adds necessary weight to grounding zones and keeps light zones open

## Major Vastu Doshas (Defects) - Critical Issues to Identify

### **High-Priority "Red Flag" Defects**

#### **Toilet/Bathroom in Wrong Zone**
- **Problem Locations**: Northeast (NE), Southwest (SW), or Center (Brahmasth치h캐)
- **Why It's Critical**: Contaminates the sacred Water zone (NE), destabilizes the foundational Earth zone (SW), or pollutes the central energy source (Brahmasth치h캐)
- **Potential Impact**: Severe health & financial problems, instability, mental unrest, obstacles to progress

#### **Kitchen in Wrong Zone**
- **Problem Locations**: Northeast (NE), Southwest (SW), or Center (Brahmasth치h캐)
- **Why It's Critical**: Creates a severe elemental clash (Fire vs. Water in NE), causes instability (in SW), or introduces disruptive fire energy into the sensitive central zone
- **Potential Impact**: Major health issues (especially for women), financial losses, family conflicts

#### **Obstruction in the Center**
- **Problem Location**: Center (Brahmasth치h캐)
- **Why It's Critical**: Blocks the primary source of vital energy for the entire house, effectively "suffocating" the space
- **Potential Impact**: Widespread chaos, lack of opportunities, financial difficulties, mental unrest

#### **Staircase in Wrong Zone**
- **Problem Locations**: Northeast (NE) or Center (Brahmasth치h캐)
- **Why It's Critical**: A heavy structural element that crushes the subtle, positive energies of the sacred NE zone or blocks the central Brahmasth치h캐
- **Potential Impact**: Financial struggles, health issues, blocks the inflow of positive energy

#### **Incorrect Water Tank Placement**
- **Problem Locations**: Underground Tank (UGT) in SW or Overhead Tank (OHT) in NE
- **Why It's Critical**: A pit in the SW destabilizes the home's foundation. A heavy weight in the NE crushes the sacred energy zone
- **Potential Impact**: Severe financial instability, health problems, accidents, lack of mental peace

#### **Inauspicious Main Entrance**
- **Problem Locations**: Southwest (SW), South (S), or Southeast (SE)
- **Why It's Critical**: SW is linked to misfortune, S to harsh energy (Yama), and SE to conflicts and fire-related issues
- **Potential Impact**: Hardships, negativity, financial struggles, health issues, conflicts

#### **Master Bedroom in Wrong Zone**
- **Problem Locations**: Southeast (SE) or Northeast (NE)
- **Why It's Critical**: SE (Fire zone) can cause arguments and health issues. NE is too sacred for this purpose and can disturb mental peace
- **Potential Impact**: Marital discord, financial instability, lack of authority for the head of the family

#### **Incorrect Sleeping Direction**
- **Problem Position**: Head pointing North
- **Why It's Critical**: Disrupts the body's natural alignment with the Earth's magnetic field, thought to drain energy
- **Potential Impact**: Disturbed sleep, stress, chronic health issues, energy drain

## Use Cases
- **Homeowners**: Analyze existing home layouts and identify critical Vastu defects
- **Architects**: Incorporate Vastu principles in new designs and avoid major doshas
- **Vastu Consultants**: Professional analysis tool with comprehensive defect identification
- **Property Buyers**: Evaluate properties for Vastu compliance and identify deal-breakers
