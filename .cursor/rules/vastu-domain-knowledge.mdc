# Vastu Shastra Domain Knowledge

## Application Context
This is a **Vastu Layout Inspector** - a tool for analyzing home layouts according to Vastu Shastra principles, an ancient Indian architectural science emphasizing directional orientation in building design.

## Vastu Principles Integration

### 8-Direction System
The application implements a complete 8-direction compass system:

1. **North (N)** - Red color - Associated with career and opportunities
2. **Northeast (NE)** - Orange color - Prayer room, spiritual energy
3. **East (E)** - Amber color - New beginnings, sunrise energy
4. **Southeast (SE)** - Lime color - Kitchen location, fire element
5. **South (S)** - Emerald color - Fame and recognition
6. **Southwest (SW)** - Cyan color - Master bedroom, stability
7. **West (W)** - Violet color - Creativity and children
8. **Northwest (NW)** - Fuchsia color - Air element, movement

### Key Vastu Guidelines
- **Entrance Placement**: Ideally in North, Northeast, or East directions
- **Kitchen Location**: Southeast (preferred) or Northwest directions
- **Master Bedroom**: Southwest for stability and prosperity
- **Prayer Room**: Northeast for maximum spiritual energy
- **Staircase Position**: Southwest, South, or West directions
- **Living Room**: Northeast, North, or East for positive energy
