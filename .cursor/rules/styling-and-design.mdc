# Styling & Design System

## Styling Architecture

### Tailwind CSS 4
- **[src/app/globals.css](mdc:src/app/globals.css)** - Global styles with Tailwind imports and custom CSS variables
- Uses CSS variables for dynamic theming
- Custom utility classes for compass-specific styling
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Color System
The application uses a specific color palette for compass directions:

```css
- North (N): Red (#dc2626)
- Northeast (NE): Orange (#ea580c)
- East (E): Amber (#d97706)
- Southeast (SE): Lime (#65a30d)
- South (S): Emerald (#059669)
- Southwest (SW): Cyan (#0891b2)
- West (W): Violet (#7c3aed)
- Northwest (NW): Fuchsia (#c026d3)
```

### Component Library
- **shadcn/ui**: Modern, accessible component system
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible primitives
- **[components.json](mdc:components.json)** - shadcn/ui configuration
- Components located in **[src/components/ui/](mdc:src/components/ui)**

## Design Patterns

### Layout Principles

- Smooth transitions and animations
- Touch-friendly sizing for mobile devices

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear typography scale
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind spacing units
- Semantic color usage
- Strategic use of shadows and borders

## CSS Organization
- Global styles in `globals.css`
- Component-specific styles using Tailwind classes
- Custom CSS variables for theming
- Utility-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Consistent class naming and organization

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first breakpoint system
- Touch-optimized compass interaction
- Adaptive image sizing
- Responsive text scaling
- Container query support where needed
